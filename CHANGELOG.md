# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Script `trifingerpro_replay_actions_from_log` to re-apply the actions from a robot log
  file.
- `plot_post_submission_log`: When run remotely (i.e. no display available) use
  [plotext](https://github.com/piccolomo/plotext) to show the plot directly in
  the terminal or save as file to /tmp if plotext is not available.
- Check camera sharpness in `trifinger_post_submission.py`.  This should alert us early,
  if a lense comes loose.

### Changed
- plot_post_submission_log.py now plots multiple log files side by side instead of
  merging them.  This is useful for comparing different robots.
  The option to merge multiple log files has been dropped but the merging can easily be
  done beforehand, e.g. using `cat` and saving to a temporary file.
- Use a position command to the configured initial position as "idle action".
  This results in the robot holding its position after initialisation instead of
  dropping down.
- `trifinger_data_backend`: Rename `--max-number-of-actions` to `--log-buffer-size`.
  The old name still works as well but is deprecated.
- `trifinger_data_backend`: Make `--log-buffer-size` (formerly
  `--max-number-of-actions`) optional if no logging is enabled.

### Fixed
- Update demo_data_logging to changed interface of the RobotLogger class.
- Update configuration for `single_finger_test` to work with current software
  version.
- Install the interface library, so other packages can link to
  `robot_fingers::robot_fingers`.

### Deprecated
- The `--max-number-of-actions/-a` argument of `trifinger_data_backend` is deprecated.
  Use `--log-buffer-size` instead.


## [1.0.0] - 2022-06-28
### Added
- Demo for forward/inverse kinematics computation for TriFingerPro.
- `trifinger_post_submission`: Measure object detection noise and trigger a
  failure if it exceeds some thresholds.
- `trifinger_post_submission`: New option `--log` to write results of the tests
  to the given log file (e.g. to monitor the object detection noise over time).

### Changed
- Make `trifinger_backend` more generic, so it can be used with TriFinger robots
  other than the "Pro" version.
- Set model for object tracking in `trifinger_backend` and
  `trifinger_robot_backend`.  This is needed due to changes in
  trifinger_object_tracking.
- Make `trifinger_post_submission` more flexible by using to separate arguments
  `--object=<object_type>` to specify the object type and `--reset` to indicate
  if the reset procedure for the given object type should be executed or not.

### Fixed
- Fix several flake8 and mypy warnings.
