"""Basic demo on how to control the Finger robot using a fake driver.

This script illustrates how to control a robot via the Python interface.  It
uses a fake driver, i.e. it can be executed without an actual robot.  The fake
driver will simply provide fake observations and ignore any actions that are
sent to it.
