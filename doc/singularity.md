About Singularity
=================

What is Singularity?
--------------------

Singularity is a tool to run software inside containers, similar to Docker.
Compared to Docker it has a higher focus on security and can be used without
root permission.  Also programs in the container are executed as the user of the
host system which makes it much more convenient when touching files of the host
system (as it is happening when building a mounted workspace).


Get our Singularity Image
-------------------------

We provide a Singularity image with Ubuntu 18.04 with all dependencies needed to
build and run the software here:

- [Download Singularity Image](TODO)


Install Singularity
-------------------

We are using Singularity version 3.6. Other recent versions are probably
also so fine, however, we cannot guarantee compatibility for those.
Unfortunately, most versions of Ubuntu still provide Singularity version
2.x in their official repositories. A newer version can be installed
from source in this case. For this you may follow the [official installation
instructions](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.6/user-guide/quick_start.html#quick-installation-steps)
or use the following, slightly simplified instructions (assuming you are working
with Ubuntu).

Install system dependencies:

    $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y \
        build-essential \
        libssl-dev \
        uuid-dev \
        libgpgme11-dev \
        squashfs-tools \
        libseccomp-dev \
        wget \
        pkg-config \
        git \
        cryptsetup

Get the required version of the Go compiler:

    cd ~/Downloads  # you can save it anywhere else, just adjust paths below
    wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    tar -xzf go1.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz

Note that it is only needed once for building singularity, so no need to
install it permanently (we just add it to PATH temporarily for building,
see below).

Now download and unpack the singularity source:

    wget https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/releases/download/v3.6.1/singularity-3.6.1.tar.gz
    tar -xzf singularity-3.6.1.tar.gz

And finally build and install it:

    export PATH=~/Downloads/go/bin:${PATH}  # adjust path if you used a different directory
    cd singularity  # the folder to which the singularity source was extracted
    ./mconfig
    cd builddir
    make
    sudo make install

Now you should be able to use Singularity. You can test this, for
example, by running `singularity --version` which should print
"singularity version 3.6.1". For more information on how to use
Singularity, see the [official
documentation](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.6/user-guide/index.html).


Run Something in the Container
------------------------------

To run the container in shell mode (i.e. opening a shell inside the container),
the following is often enough:

    singularity shell path/to/image.sif

This will, however, be influenced by your local setup as environment variables
are exported and the home directory is mounted by default.  Further the current
working directory from which singularity is run is also bound inside the
container.

This default behaviour is often convenient but can cause issues in some cases.
A typical example would be a Python package installed in your home directory
(which will then be available in the container) which is not compatible with
versions of other packages inside the container.  To avoid these kind of issues
it is recommended to use the following command to run the container in a more
isolated way:

    export SINGULARITYENV_DISPLAY=$DISPLAY
    singularity shell -e --no-home -B $(pwd) path/to/image.sif

The arguments explained:

- The first line makes sure the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly
  inside the container (only needed if you want to run GUI-based applications).
- `-e` (short for `--cleanenv`) prevents environment variables to be
  exported.
- `--no-home` prevents your home directory from being bound.
- `-B $(pwd)` explicitly binds the current working directory.  This should
  normally not be necessary but Singularity 3.6 seems to have a bug that the PWD
  is not bound automatically if it is somewhere inside your home directory and
  `--no-home` is used.

Note that with the above the current working directory is still bound in the
image, so it is possible to build/modify the workspace from the host-system when
Singularity is run from the root directory of the workspace.


### Compatibility with Nvidia Drivers

When you are using Nvidia drivers and want to run a GUI-based application in the
container, you may need to add the `--nv` flag:

    singularity shell --nv ... path/to/image.sif


Add Custom Dependencies to the Container
----------------------------------------

The image we provide already includes everything needed to run the robot
and the simulation. However, you may need additional libraries to use
them in our own code, which are not yet present. In this case, you can
create your own image which is based on our standard image but extends
it with your additional dependencies.

To extend the image, create *definition file* like the following:

    # Specify the name of the base image below
    Bootstrap: localimage
    From: ./base_image.sif

    %post
        # Put commands to install additional dependencies here.
        # Make sure everything runs automatically without human input (e.g. add
        # `-y` to automatically say "yes" below).
        apt-get install -y package_name

See the official [Documentation for Definition
Files](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.6/user-guide/definition_files.html)
for all options in the definition file.

Assuming you called your definition file `user_image.def`, use the
following command to build the image. Note that the base image
(specified in the `From:` line) needs to be present in the directory in
which you call the command.

    $ singularity build --fakeroot user_image.sif path/to/user_image.def
