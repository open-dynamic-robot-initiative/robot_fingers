Getting Started
===============

This package implements a RobotDriver and several applications for the TriFinger
robots, using the [`robot_interfaces`
package](https://open-dynamic-robot-initiative.github.io/code_documentation/robot_interfaces/docs/doxygen/html/index.html).
See there for more information on the general architecture.  The action and
observation types for the (Tri)Finger robots are also implemented in
`robot_interfaces`.

For a basic example on how to control the robot, see
[demo_real_finger.py](https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/robot_fingers/blob/master/demos/demo_real_finger.py)
and the other
[demos](https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/robot_fingers/blob/master/demos).
