# Build the package and run tests, using the latest trifinger_user Apptainer
# image.
# The Apptainer image has a full ROBOT_FINGERS workspace installed, so all
# dependencies are there and only the checked package needs to be build, not the
# whole workspace.
#
# Note: The Apptainer image only gets automatically rebuild, if something in the
# image definition changes, not when other packages are changed.  So to avoid
# that the workspace in the container gets outdated, manual builds need to be
# triggered regularly.
