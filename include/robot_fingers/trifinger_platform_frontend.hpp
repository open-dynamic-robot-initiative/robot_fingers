 * @brief Combined frontend for the TriFinger Platform
 *
 * This class combines the frontends for robot, cameras and object tracking in
 * one class using unified time indices.
 *
 * Internally the different frontends all have their own time indices which are
 * unrelated to each other.  In this combined class, the time index used is the
 * one that belongs to the robot frontend.  When accessing observations of the
 * other frontends, it also takes this index t and internally matches it to the
 * time index t_o that was active in the other frontend at the time of t.
 *
 * @todo Methods to get timestamp from camera or object tracker?

    /**
     * @brief Find time index of frontend that matches with the given robot time
     *        index.
     *
     * The given time index t_robot refers to the robot data time series.  To
     * provide the correct observation from the other frontend for this time
     * step, find the highest time index t_other of the other frontend where
     *
     *      timestamp(t_other) <= timestamp(t_robot)
     *
     * Note that this is not always the one that is closest w.r.t. to the
     * timestamp, i.e.
     *
     *      t_other != argmin(|timestamp(t_other) - timestamp(t_robot)|)
     *
     * The latter would not be deterministic: the outcome could change when
     * called twice with the same `t_robot` if a new "other" observation
     * arrived in between the calls.
     *
     * @todo The implementation below is very naive.
     *       It simply does a linear search starting from the latest time index.
     *       So worst case performance is O(n) where n is the number of "other"
     *       observations over the period that is covered by the buffer of the
     *       robot data.
     *
     *       Options to speed this up:
     *        - binary search (?)
     *        - estimate time step size based on last observations
     *        - store matched indices of last call
     *
     *       Note, however, that `t_robot` is very likely the latest time index
     *       in most cases.  In this case the match for `t_other` will also be
     *       the latest index of the corresponding time series.  In this case,
     *       the complexity is O(1).  So even when implementing a more complex
     *       search algorithm, the first candidate for `t_other` that is checked
     *       should always be the latest one.
     *
     * @tparam FrontendType Type of the frontend.  This is templated so that the
     *     same implementation can be used for both camera and object tracker
     *     frontend.
     * @param other_frontend The frontend for which a matching time index needs
     *     to be found.
     * @param t_robot Time index of the robot frontend.

     * @return Time index for other_frontend which is/was active at the time of
     *     t_robot.
